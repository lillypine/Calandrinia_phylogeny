IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Calandrinia_eremea_nonpapillate_139 and Calandrinia_eremaea_ss_33 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file /users/lhancock/data/sequences/analyses_temp/lph_lane6_20161104/Ln_1t6/Ln1t6_prunedgenetrees1/Ln1t6pgt1_nGroup_1537_5.phy.reduced

RAxML rapid bootstrapping and subsequent ML search

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization



Executing 100 rapid bootstrap inferences and thereafter a thorough ML search 

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
ML estimate of 25 per site rate categories

Likelihood of final tree will be evaluated and optimized under GAMMA

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

Partition: 0
Alignment Patterns: 340
Name: No Name Provided
DataType: DNA
Substitution Matrix: GTR
