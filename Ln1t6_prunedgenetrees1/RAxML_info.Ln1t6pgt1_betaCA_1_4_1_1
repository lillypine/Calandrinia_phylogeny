IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Cistanthe_paniculaeta_223 and Cistanthe_sp_219 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Alignment has 358 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 50.66%

RAxML rapid bootstrapping and subsequent ML search

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization



Executing 100 rapid bootstrap inferences and thereafter a thorough ML search 

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
ML estimate of 25 per site rate categories

Likelihood of final tree will be evaluated and optimized under GAMMA

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

Partition: 0
Alignment Patterns: 358
Name: No Name Provided
DataType: DNA
Substitution Matrix: GTR
